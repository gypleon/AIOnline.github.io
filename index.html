  <h1>AIOnline</h1>
    <p>
      The website's original name "Aleon" is inspired by "AI" (Artificial Intelligence) and my English name "Leon", meanwhile, also could be interpretted as "a Leon".<br>
      Unfortunately, this perfect name has been occupied by a luck man so that I choose current "AIOline" which may be much more resounding but lake of my personal spirit. Anyway, I wish my future work won't let this bright name down.<br>
      Due to extremely limited time, everything is under construction. Currently, the site is only used for some valuable notes.

      <h3>Cheat Sheet for C++ Template</h3>
      <p>
        The second one you actually show in your question, though you might not realize it:<br>
        <b>template < template < typename, typename > class Container, typename Type ></b><br>
        When specifying a template template, the class keyword MUST be used as above -- it is not interchangeable with typename in this case.

      <h3>STL</h3>
        <h4>'const' and 'constexpr'</h4>
        <p>
          <b>const</b> declares an object as constant. This implies a guarantee that, once initialized, the value of that object won't change, and the compiler can make use of this fact for optimizations. It also helps prevent the programmer from writing code that modifies objects that were not meant to be modified after initialization.<br>
          <b>constexpr</b> declares an object as fit for use in what the Standard calls constant expressions. But note that constexpr is not the only way to do this.
